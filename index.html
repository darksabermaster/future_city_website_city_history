<p>
This was the platform that we started with. Just a wooden board with random pieces of colored foam. We needed to remove those pieces to continue working on the city.
</p>
</div>

<div class="animat2">

<p>
After we <!--waowed-->removed any unnecessary foam from the board, we attached sand paper to the bottom for a realistic sea bottom. Which in hindsight wasn't the most fun for our fingers, but it worked nonetheless!
</p>

<p>
When we finished adding sandpaper and sprinkling sand, we completed a base for the sea level out of bamboo, pvc connecters, and plexiglass. We also reserved space for a demonstration on how our wave-based energy system works.

<div class="animat2">
<img src="mitchell_cross.jpg" alt="the best way to learn html is to ignore tutorials, and trial and error your way through it. Thats what I did! And this is the result! This website turned out-... Semi-presentable! However I do tend to learn things pretty weird... And there's school and stuff... Nevermind! Completely neglect everything that i just told you!" style="height: 260px; width: 346.666666667px; text-align: center; border: 10px solid #E2FFE2; border-radius: 5px;" class="center">

<p>
The base and the demo have been installed and now we were working on the layout of the islands. We were also planning on where to put certain structures, plates, cuts and more. We were making some fast progress here. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="animat2">
<img src="mitchell_color.jpg" alt="hi :)" style="height: 260px; width: 346.666666667px; text-align: center; border: 10px solid #E2FFE2; border-radius: 5px;" class="center">

<p>
Now we were laying down felt and fake grass onto the island segments to attach buildings and structures to. We also painted all of the buildings prior to this and they were dry and ready to glue on.
</p>

<p>
Finally we can work on the finishing touches and glue on the last pieces of the city. We finish by glueing down city buildings, greenery, and painting some structures that were previously barren.
